1. Bulge-disk decomposition.
	- fit Sersic profiles for bulge and stellar disk particle seperately.
	-take radial shells of the remnant
	- M~L
	- maybe make "isophote" contours?
	use scipy.optimize?

2. Velocity dispersions

	after flipping the galaxy get 3d(1d?) velocities and analytic circular velocities
	- compare bulge to disk particles to see what elliptical should look like
	- compare dispersions to circular velocities
